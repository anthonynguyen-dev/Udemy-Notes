Web browsers such as google chrome safari and firefox all interperet your html, css, and other files into a website that should be displayed
html is the foundation of our website
html will enable you to display text, forums, or images
html stands for HyperText Markup Language (mark up being the important words)
using headings "h1" and so on
the bigger the number the smaller the text will be 
to create a space between text you can use <br> which is a line break

ex. <h1> is the starting tag while </h1> is the end tag and everything in between is the content you put into these tags
ex. <br> is a tag that doesn't need a closing tag which is called a self-closing tag (there are more self-closing tags)
ex. <hr> self closing tag that creates a horizontal line, to make thicker or thinner you can <hr size=""> this is an html attribute that show how you want your element displayed
to look at the html and css in a browser you can right click and click "inspect" to see all the code written down
attributes come after the main html element and is seperated by a single space

index.html is typically the homepage for the code editor you're using
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en" dir="ltr">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title></title>
  </head>
  <body>
    
  </body>
</html> all this is standard "boiler plate code"
this is like having a codwe template something you will reuse for different projects
when using html you will see <!DOCTYPE html> which shows the type of document it
this tells the browser to render the file as a html5 document
the head of html holds information about the webpage and tells the browser how to handle the page
meta elements give extra meta data or associated data to the html document
the body of the html 

indents will help the organization of your code
you can use <i></i> to italisize and <b></b> to bold text

img is the html element and the html attribute is src=
<img src=""> the src can be a link from the internet or an image on your local system
HyperText are text documents that can be connected together through hyperlinks 
<a></a> is an anchor tag while an href is an attribute that contains the url or a url fragment
<a href=""></a>
ex. of html table format
<table>
    <tr>
        <td></td>
        <td></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td></td>
        <td></td>
    </tr>
</table>

input types can be text submit and etc depending on what function you want

html forms 
use form tag to define what should go into your form 
to us this you need label and input tags

a repository is just a folder that will hold your project related files\
you can change and update the files and keep track of said changes and updates
